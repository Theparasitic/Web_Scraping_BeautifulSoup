# Web_Scraping_BeautifulSoup
As a part of learning web scraping(Beginnner Level) using python's BeautifulSoup Module, these are the some scripts I have written to extract relevant information. Some of them were formatted into csv files
Only requirement is pip for installing BeautifulSoup Moduel and rest is just to run file and have a look at the extracted information ;)
